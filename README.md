First Markdown Page

Github is a platform used for storing, tracking and collaborating on software. Prior to this day, I didn't know about Markdown pages on github. And since I would like to be a litte extra sometimes (XD), I made <html><a href="./learned.html"> second page </a></html> to talk about what I learned.
